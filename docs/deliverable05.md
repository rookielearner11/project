# Deliverable 5

Your group will have exactly 15 minutes for presenting your work (including setup time).

## Plagiarism notice

As discussed in tutorials, you should absolutely refrain from copying entire blocks of code from the internet. Note what was mentioned in the project description at the beginning of the semester:

"Students are encouraged to use the available toolset in android studio but should refrain from copying whole blocks of code from the internet to implement features. Should a group want to use a non-standard tool/API they should request permission before doing so."

You donâ€™t want your hard work in this course to be lost because of this. Code plagiarism might lead to you failing the course.

## Structure
It is recommended that you train for your presentation and divide your allotted time as
follows:

* 2 minutes for setup,
* 8 minutes to present your work,
* 5 minutes for questions from your TA.

The TA will cut you off at 15 minutes, and the next group will _begin_.

All members of your team _should_ be present, only if no timeslot
(any of the labs, or tutorial time) absolutely do not work will we will
allow teams to present _twice_.  You must show the TA your schedule
to receive such an exemption, and then you are alotted 10 minutes for each presentation.

## Appproach

Divide the presentation time among group members.

Let every group member talk about the parts of the application he/she worked on.

Do not expect the TA to guide you on what you should say during your presentation.

You are responsible for showing and explaining everything you did during your presentation time.

Since this might be the first presentation you perform at the University, it is strongly recommended
that you invest some time on preparing a comprehensive, well structured presentation of your work.

Questions from the TA should be answered by the group member who did the part the TA is asking about.

## Marking Scheme

| Feature or Task | Weight (/100) |
| --- | --- |
| 3 user types implemented (admin, homeowner, SP) | 40 |
| Can create new service types | 5 |
| At least 10 service types implemented | 5 |
| A rate is associated with every service | 5 |
| Service providers can associate their accounts with one or more services | 5 |
| Service providers can indicate their availability | 5 |
| Homeowners can search for a service | 5 |
| Homeowners can book a service with a service provider | 5 |
| Homeowners can rate a service | 5 |
| Preparation, clarity, and work distribution, all members present | 20 |

The TA might ask you to create new accounts

### Note

3 user types implemented has the highest weight because it includes whether or not your application has separation of tasks (only admin can create new services, only service providers can indicate availability, only homeowners can book a service and rate it...)

* 10 marks for each user type, and
* 10 marks if all three are correctly implemented.

## Feedback

The TA will give comments and suggestions about your work.

It is recommended that you take them into consideration and improve on them before your final submission.

The grading of your submission will take into consideration the noted comments of the TA and how
you improved your work based on those comments.
